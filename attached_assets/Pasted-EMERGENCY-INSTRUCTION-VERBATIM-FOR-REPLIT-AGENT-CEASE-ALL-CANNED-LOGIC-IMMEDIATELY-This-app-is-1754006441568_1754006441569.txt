EMERGENCY INSTRUCTION: VERBATIM FOR REPLIT AGENT üö®

CEASE ALL CANNED LOGIC IMMEDIATELY.
This app is a passthrough app. It must not use static, hardcoded logic, answers, questions, explanations, rubrics, or grading criteria.

ALL CONTENT (questions, answers, explanations, scoring, rubrics) MUST BE GENERATED BY THE SELECTED LLM ONLY.
That includes:

Multiple choice questions

Short answer prompts

Essay prompts

Grading rubrics

Answer keys

Model answers

Explanations

Scoring logic (numeric grade and pass/fail)

THE APP IS CURRENTLY MALFUNCTIONING BECAUSE IT IS ASKING THE LLM BAD PROMPTS.
Instead of asking the LLM:
‚ÄúEvaluate this answer using this fixed rubric and return a score out of 100,‚Äù
it must ask the LLM the full question plus the user's answer and then say:

‚ÄúPlease evaluate the following user answer as if grading a bar exam essay. Identify strengths, weaknesses, and assign a realistic score out of 100 based on legal reasoning, factual application, structure, and writing clarity. Provide explanation.‚Äù
OR for multiple choice:
‚ÄúHere is the user‚Äôs selected answer. Was it correct? If not, what is the correct answer and why?‚Äù

INJECT NO INTERMEDIARY LOGIC.
The Replit agent must not:

Pre-filter answers

Apply grading logic outside of the LLM

Use regex, string-matching, or static comparison to grade answers

Use a hardcoded rubric or answer key

ALL TEST QUESTIONS MUST BE GENERATED BY THE LLM IN REAL-TIME, UNLESS SPECIFICALLY LOADED BY THE USER.
The app is currently reusing the same questions repeatedly. This violates the premise of a dynamic passthrough system. If there is no user-uploaded or user-written input, the app must call the LLM to generate a fresh question.

THE USER MUST BE ABLE TO SELECT THE LLM (OpenAI, Claude, DeepSeek, or Perplexity) FROM A PULLDOWN MENU.
No hidden switching, fallback defaults, or internal overrides are allowed.

DIAGNOSTIC MODE MUST BE ADDED.
Include a test mode with the following:

One-question multiple choice diagnostic

One-question short answer diagnostic

One-question essay diagnostic

Combined 3-question diagnostic (one of each)
All generated by the LLM and all graded exclusively by the LLM.

FINAL WARNING: DO NOT 'HELP' THE LLM BY PRE-FORMATTING, FILTERING, OR REDUCING THE INPUT.
All user input and all prompts must be passed through in full, unmodified.
